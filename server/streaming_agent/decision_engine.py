"""The control loop: when does she get to speak?

Drains events into AgentState, walks a short list of rules, and hands the
finished payload to whoever asked for it (the conversation loop). Today only
one rule fires: you finished talking. Everything else is context.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDING A NEW TRIGGER RULE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each rule is a method ``self._rule_xxx(now: float) -> Optional[str]`` returning
a short trigger reason (e.g. ``"voice_input"``) when it should fire, else
``None``. To add a rule:

    1. Implement ``_rule_my_thing(self, now)`` on this class.
    2. Append it to ``self.rules`` in ``__init__``.

That's it. ``_should_respond`` walks the list in order and the first match
wins. Keep rules short and side-effect-free.
