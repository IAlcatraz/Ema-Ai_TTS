"""The bridge between Python and the browser. Start this first.

It does two jobs:
  - takes commands from the Python side (speak this clip, play this
    animation, look sad) and pushes them to the web page over a WebSocket;
  - takes uploads from the web page (mic clip, typed message, image) and
    parks them until the conversation loop picks them up.

Run it from the PROJECT FOLDER, not from inside server/:

    python -m server.server

Every endpoint lives in `server/routes/`. To add one:
  1. Add the request model to `routes/schemas.py`.
  2. Add the handler to whichever module fits (or start a new one).
  3. If it is a new module, add an `app.include_router(...)` line below.

The full list of endpoints is in `server/routes/README.md`.
