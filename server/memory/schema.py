"""Pydantic schemas for a single memory and a batch of memories.

These are the *stored* shape — rich enough to support future scoring
upgrades (VAD, type, tone) without a DB rewrite. The character LLM never
sees these fields; only `summary` is injected into the prompt (see
`store.retrieve_formatted`).

Fields are unchanged from the original multi-user `faiss_memory.py` so the
on-disk JSON format stays compatible.
