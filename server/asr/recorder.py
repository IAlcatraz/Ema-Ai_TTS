"""Mic capture: records once speech is detected, stops on sustained silence.

Sole public function: `record_on_speech`. Writes a 16-bit PCM WAV to
`output_file` and returns its path. No model loading — keep this module
import-light so `server.streaming_agent.inputs.voice_input` doesn't pay
for whisper/groq at process start.

Two ways to decide "is the user still talking":

  Silero VAD (default)  A trained speech detector — see `server/asr/vad.py`.
                        Ignores keyboards and fans, and still hears the quiet
                        tail of a sentence, so `silence_duration` can be short.
  fixed RMS threshold   The original: block loudness vs a constant. Kept as a
                        fallback via `ENABLE_SILERO_VAD = False`.

Run `python -m server.asr.recorder` to capture a one-off clip to
`/tmp/asr_test.wav` — handy for confirming the mic device works.
